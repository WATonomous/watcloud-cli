### watcloud subscription <job_id> [email]

Get notified when a SLURM job finishes.

| Usage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `watcloud subscription <job_id> <email>` | Email notification when the job completes |
| `watcloud subscription <job_id> --discord` | Discord notification using `$WATCLOUD_DISCORD_WEBHOOK` |
| `watcloud subscription <job_id> --discord <webhook_url>` | Discord notification with an explicit webhook |

To avoid pasting your Discord webhook every time, export it from your shell profile (e.g. `~/.bashrc`). Anyone who can read the webhook can post to your channel, so keep that file readable only by you:

```sh
export WATCLOUD_DISCORD_WEBHOOK=<webhook_url>
```

To get a webhook URL, in your Discord channel: **Edit Channel → Integrations → Webhooks → New Webhook → Copy Webhook URL**.
